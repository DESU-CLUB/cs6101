Our reading group will be conducted as a group seminar, with class participants nominating themselves and presenting the materials and leading the discussion. There will be a total of 8 sessions for Sem II AY2020/2021 every biweekly Friday 1-3 pm. Please see the detailed schedule in the below table. On the alternate Thursdays 1-3 pm, we will have project consultations sessions.

<a href="http://cs6101.slack.com/">A mandatory discussion group is on Slack</a>. Students and guests, please login when you are free. If you have a @comp.nus.edu.sg, @u.nus.edu, @nus.edu.sg, @a-star.edu.sg, @dsi.a-star.edu.sg or @i2r.a-star.edu.sg. email address you can create your Slack account for the group discussion without needing an invite.

**For interested public participants**, please send Min an email at ```kanmy@comp.nus.edu.sg``` if you need an invite to the Slack group.  The Slack group is being reused from previous semesters.  Once you are in the Slack group, you can consider yourself registered for the group.

## Schedule

The sessions will be broadcast live via the customized Zoom link as advertised on the [Slack group](http://cs6101.slack.com).  For semi-privacy reasons, the group meeting ID and access is not publicly disseminated here on the webpage.
