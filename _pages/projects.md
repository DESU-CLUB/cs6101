Here we archive and cross link all of the past projects done by our first year Ph.D. students, undergraduate and external guests that take part in our reading group.  Generally, when students and participants outside of WING join the reading group they must also complete a related project touching on some part of the lecture topics.  These projects often get presented publicly in the forum of our School of Computing's Term Project Showcase (STePS).

## Projects from Semester 2020 (AY 20/21, Sem II) featured at <a href="https://uvents.nus.edu.sg/event/18th-steps">18th STePs</A>, held on 14 April 2021.

In AY20/21 Sem II, CS6101 was topically oriented on **[Conversational Recommendation Systems](https://uvents.nus.edu.sg/event/18th-steps/module/CS6101)**.  There were 26 students in 10 teams whose projects focused on recent research on the topics of Conversational Systems, Recommender Systems and their intersections.

        <p style="font-size:18px">Extending the Neural Collaborative Filtering Framework to improve model understanding and robustness. Using additional Convolutional layers, Pairwise Loss Function and Auxiliary Information Embedding to explore potential model improvements.<BR /></p>
        <h2>‚úçÔ∏è Description </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px">In our project, we explore the potential extensions to the Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) Framework to improve model understanding and robustness. Using additional Convolutional layers, Pairwise Loss Function and Auxiliary Information Embedding, we experiment with the MovieLens-1M dataset to attain better model performance on Hit Rate and NDCG metrics while attempting to improve model understanding through auxiliary embeddings.<BR /></p>

        <h2>üìñ Abstract </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px">In this project, we study popularity bias in Recommender System (RecSys), Conversational Recsys, and their interplays.<BR /></p>
        <h2>‚úçÔ∏è Description </h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px">We discover (1) conversation can significantly mitigate popularity bias for traditional RecSys; (2) Conversation RecSys suffers from popularity bias itself. We propose a method to mitigate popularity bias in Conversational RecSys. Please refer to our poster for technical details. Our experiment is still WIP, we will update on this github repo: https://github.com/YisongMiao/cs6101 <BR/></p>
