Here we archive and cross link all of the past projects done by our first year Ph.D. students, undergraduate and external guests that take part in our reading group.  Generally, when students and participants outside of WING join the reading group they must also complete a related project touching on some part of the lecture topics.  These projects often get presented publicly in the forum of our School of Computing's Term Project Showcase (STePS).

## Projects from Semester 2020 (AY 20/21, Sem II) featured at <a href="https://uvents.nus.edu.sg/event/18th-steps">18th STePs</A>, held on 14 April 2021.

In AY20/21 Sem II, CS6101 was topically oriented on **[Conversational Recommendation Systems](https://uvents.nus.edu.sg/event/18th-steps/module/CS6101)**.  There were 26 students in 10 teams whose projects focused on recent research on the topics of Conversational Systems, Recommender Systems and their intersections.
