# Web IR / NLP Group (WING) @ NUS Reading Group / Public Course
### For AY 2023/2024 Semester I (2310)

This repo builds the static `github.io` website for the main reading group.  Students assigned to the _support_ role are expected to edit the `about.md` file in the `_pages` subdirectory to update both this github.com page and the corresponding github.io pages site.

See the [about.md](https://github.com/WING-NUS/cs6101/blob/master/_pages/about.md) document for the details on the papers reviewed, staff assigned and links to external references, inclusive of the recorded sessions.

Note: the coloring for the page is controlled in `_sass/_variables.scss`, tables by `_sass/_tables.scss`
